    <h2>July Movement</h2>
    <h2>July is a special month for me. Not only for me, but also for the rest of the country and it's people.
        <br>Specially for the Gen Z. On the 5th of August, a bunch of people gathered in the center of the country, in it's 
        <br>capital city Dhaka for a movement that changed the entire history of the country. <br>It is remembered as 36th of July.
    </h2>

    <p>Operration Gen Z</p>
    Once upon a time, there was a mafia magi in the city named Hasina magi. A city that is full of terror.
    <br> A city that is full of injustice. It was led by a great mafia magi named Hasina.
    <br>Everybody from boys to girl, ladies to pearl was afraid of her atrocities.
    <br>Nobody has dare to fight her. A man age of 25, named jhankar, been grown up in the city.
    <br>He has been observing the situation while others don't. 
    <br>In a mesmerizing day of July, he decided to confront the mafia magi with his team of Gen z.
    <br>He has some special weapons that the mafia magi's team don't recognise. Some of his weapons
    <br>are : html,css,git and github. These are powerful weapons. When Jhankar and his team threw these 
    <br> weapons upon them , Hasina magi's magi team got blown up and hosted in Amazon rainforest
    <br> and never came back in the city. After that, the city became peaceful and calm. 
    <br> The name of the city now remembered as the City of Programming Heroes.
